-- Scan reveals VNC, X11, SSH, and hidden admin folders (nmap enumerate)
-- Turns out after some refreshed only SSH, DNS, and HTTP were open ports.
-- Hint on the forum suggested looking at OS distribution and version (as well
   as possible SSH version) for vulnerabilities. CVE-2016-1908 looks promising.
-- After so much fucking research it turns out since this is running on
   Raspberry Pi, the default Raspberry Pi password wasn't changed. WTF

-- Basic info gathering:

uname -a
Linux raspberrypi 3.16.0-4-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 3.16.36-1+deb8u2 (2016-10-19) i686 GNU/Linux

-- If default pi user's password isn't changed, what about root? ... it works. However,

cat root.txt
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...

Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

-- basic fsck doesn't work. lost+found is empty. Let's try some advanced tools:

root@raspberrypi:~# file -sL /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data, UUID=635bcd7f-1d95-4229-bf13-3e722026db3c (extents) (huge files)

-- This shows ext4 file system. Attempt to use extundelete (uploaded):

ext2fs missing.

-- I was finally able to recover the file by directly grepping the /dev/sdb
   device and looking through raw output for suspicious text. The USB is only
   8.7 MB large so I basically downloaded the entire image and grepped it.
-- Deleted raw-grep.txt because too large and too little data.
